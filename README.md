First and foremost I offer my sincere phrases of thanks with innate humility to our Principal   Dr. B. S. Anami who has been a constant source of support and encouragement. 
I would like to thank our Dean Academics Dr. S. G. Joshi for his constant support and guidance. 
I feel deeply indebted to our H.O.D. Dr. Yerriswamy T. for the right help provided from the time of inception till date.
